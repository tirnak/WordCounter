The tree construction shall start by creating a node for each unique word, where a node
has a field to keep track of the occurrence count. The algorithm starts with the two least
occurring nodes and creates a parent node. The parent node gets assigned an occurrence
count that is the sum of the word occurrences. The process then repeats, it locates the
two nodes with the least occurrence count, creates a parent node, and so on, until all
nodes are part of the tree.
